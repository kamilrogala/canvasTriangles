# Project: ajaxTesting

When I was taking a shower I saw inspiration at the label of my shampoo. Yeah, really!
There were some semitransparent, overlapped triangles in few variations.
I thought
>Damn, it could be quite funny animation if it was on website... wait... I can do it!

So... yeah. Inspirations for code are everywhere!
